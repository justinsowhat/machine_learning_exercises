# Classification Algorithms

Naive Bayes, Maxent, and HMM were programming assignments in grad school (fun time).

Naive Bayes is used to perform blog author gender classification.

Maxent is used to perform Yelp review rating classification (the Yelp review json file is not included due to the size).

HMM is used to perform NER on WSJ articles.

Coreference resolution project uses the logistic regression implementation from `scikit-learn`. It uses the CoNLL 2012 dataset.

What I'd like to do next, if I have the time:
* SVM (maybe include different kernel functions?)
* CRF
* decision tree
* random forest
